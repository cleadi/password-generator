# password-generator
Boot Camp HW #3

## Project Description

- This application generates a new password that is between 8 and 128 characters in length, composed of a random mix of numeric, uppercase, lowercase, and/or special characters. The user will get prompted to try again if they fail to enter a numeric value between 8 and 128.
- The user is prompted to start the password generation process when they click on the "Generate Password" button displayed on the middle of the webpage.
- The user will then select "Cancel" -- which is no -- or "OK" -- which is yes -- for whether or not the password should include numeric, uppercase, lowercase, and/or special characters.
- Once the user has selected yes or no to all the prompts, a password will be displayed beneath the title "Generate a password" on the same webpage.
